Things to do post launch:
Grey out old events and make an past years events link
Suggest they add a pdf or info on why sponsoring is awesome(optional)
Add more to articles, feature button, archive, select_team, select events

Prelaunch Bug list:
1) Race_Schedule create broken in production:
    hmmm, it doesn't like my color form select, that's OK for now, I will put some code in once Shane adds a few events
    
2) Edit and Delete needed for index and show pages, some are missing (team)
3) Landing page, logical way to show news_feed without clutter
4) Standings Model
5) Old standings, pdf pages (not putting it in the model at this time, don't want to add old races)
6) Videos, model
7) Integrate old news_feeds for archived years
8) Title meta tags
9) Menus and footers
10) Design review, usability
11) Test - rspec
12) Devise, make sure authenticate_user is in place in controllers
13) Photos by team
14) Photos by event
15) Videos (model)
16) Views for Archive
17) May want to run titles to see if typos
18) Suggestion, CTA for sponsorship and membership, not a lot of info on the site
19) Clean up readme page

List of dumbass errors and dev notes.
I know there are lots of duplicate models, articles, news_feed, sponsors... For now, kept separate as workflow is so different for each
Churned on drop down colors, ended up simply adding a ';' at the end of my css

fixed broken links on sponsor logos

Rails broke, this command fixed it.
rake app:update:bin
